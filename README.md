# Airline-satisfaction-analysis
This airline passenger satisfaction project focuses on analyzing extensive passenger data to uncover insights into the factors influencing passenger satisfaction with the airline. 
We will explore various factors, including departure and arrival time convenience, ease of online booking and online boarding, gate location, on-board and check-in services, 
as well as in-flight amenities such as Wi-Fi services, entertainment, and food and beverage options. 
Additionally, we'll consider customer profiles, including age, gender, type of travel, and ticket class. 
This comprehensive analysis will help us identify the key drivers of satisfaction and provide actionable recommendations for improving the overall passenger experience
